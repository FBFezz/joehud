# Joe HUD (HUD, Seatbelt & Speedlimiter)

Joe HUD (HUD, Seatbelt & Speedlimiter) - This is my first project & all feedback would be greatly appreciated - A HUD inspired by Cosmo_HUD & Nopixel 3.0 For FiveM (ESX)

## Installation

1. Put 'joehud' into your 'resources' folder.

2. Start in servercfg.

Do not change the name or most parts will not function.*

## Features

• HUD elements toggled in /hud are saved to the users cache, meaning you don’t need to turn every element on and off each time you load into the server.

• Seatbelt System & Speed limiter with mappable keybinds

• 0.08ms - 0.20ms (Needs to be optimized, if you have suggestions please comment them)

• Circle Map & Streamed minimap/bigmap

• Change how often speedomoter updates in /hud to reduce or increase depending on PC

• Server sided commands / functions

## Requirements

• esx_status
• esx_basicneeds
• mumble-voip
• LegacyFuel
• esx_society
• es_extended

## USAGE
• /hud - Opens HUD menu to enable/disable elements of the HUD (Prefrences saved to cache).
